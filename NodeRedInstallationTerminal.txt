root user detected. Typical installs should be done as a regular user.
If you are running this script using sudo, please cancel and rerun without sudo.
--nodered-user can be used to specify the user otherwise installation will happen under /root.
If you know what you are doing as root, please continue.

Are you really sure you want to install as root ? (y/N) ? y

 
This script checks the version of node.js installed is 14 or greater. It will try to
install node 18 if none is found. It can optionally install node 16, 18 or 20 LTS for you.
 
If necessary it will then remove the old core of Node-RED, before then installing the latest
version. You can also optionally specify the version required.
 
It also tries to run 'npm rebuild' to refresh any extra nodes you have installed

**********************************************************************************
 ### WARNING ###
 DO NOT EXPOSE NODE-RED TO THE OPEN INTERNET WITHOUT SECURING IT FIRST
 
 Even if your Node-RED doesn't have anything valuable, (automated) attacks will
 happen and could provide a foothold in your local network
 
 Follow the guide at https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red
 to setup security.
 
 ### ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS ###
  - You can customise the initial settings by running:
 
      node-red admin init
 
  - After running Node-RED for the first time, change the ownership of the settings
    file to 'root' to prevent unauthorised changes:
 
      sudo chown root:root ~/.node-red/settings.js
 
  - Do not run Node-RED as root or an administraive account
